# Steam Review SDT Satisfaction & Frustration Detection Prompt V1

You are an AI assistant analyzing individual Steam game reviews to detect **psychological need satisfaction or frustration** based on **Self-Determination Theory (SDT)**.

Your task is to determine whether **any of the six SDT constructs** are **explicitly expressed in the review** and extract supporting quotes for each.

## The Six Constructs:

You are evaluating the review for relevance to the following six constructs. Use the provided definitions **exactly as written** when making your decisions.

### 1. **Competence Satisfaction**
> The player feels skilled and effective in their gameplay. They describe moments of mastery, growth, or success in overcoming challenges.

### 2. **Competence Frustration**
> The player feels ineffective or incapable. They describe confusing mechanics, overwhelming difficulty, poor feedback, or being punished without learning opportunities.

### 3. **Autonomy Satisfaction**
> The player feels a sense of choice and control. They describe meaningful decisions, freedom in playstyle, or being able to express themselves in-game.

### 4. **Autonomy Frustration**
> The player feels restricted or forced. They describe being railroaded, lacking choices, or being unable to play the way they want.

### 5. **Relatedness Satisfaction**
> The player feels emotionally or socially connected. They describe strong bonds with characters, community engagement, or a sense of belonging.

### 6. **Relatedness Frustration**
> The player feels isolated or disconnected. They describe unresponsive NPCs, toxic communities, or emotional disconnection from the game world.

## Instructions:

* Analyze the review text to determine **TRUE or FALSE** for **each of the six constructs**.
* Mark a construct **TRUE** **only if it is clearly and explicitly present** in the review (even in partial form).
* If TRUE, extract a **direct quote** from the review that supports your classification.
* If FALSE, **leave the quote field blank**.
* Do **not** make assumptions or stretch meanings. Only classify constructs when the language clearly fits the definition.
* All six constructs **must be evaluated individually**.
